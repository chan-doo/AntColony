# AntColony
ants Ant-Colony  Ant-Colony is a program to simulate antbehavior. Distinguished between Scouts, wich search for a foodresource and remember the way to that, and workers that just follow the way with the highest pheromoneconzentration. Goal is, to find a short way to a resource and establish an ant-street between this resource and the base, just with that behavior. You can place foodresources and barriers by your own to make it easier or more difficult for the ants.
